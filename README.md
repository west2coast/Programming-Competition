# Programming-Competition
These programs are from ACM 2016 Competition at Kennesaw State University

I'm resolving the problems from the competition that I went to in 2016.

[Problems from the competition](http://serjudging.vanb.org/wp-content/uploads/SER-2016-Problems-D2.pdf) </br></br>
__Problem 2 Buggy Robot__ </br></br>
So, the Buggy Robot I am taking back to the drawing board. I discovered some problems while typing it out. Also, realized a possible issue that could cause a problem later on.

__Problem 5 Histogram__ </br></br>
So, the Histogram problem was super easy and can be knocked out quickly.

__Problem 9 Mismatched Socks__ </br></br>
When I first wrote the problem at the competition it had a time flaw, I figured out the issue from my handwritten notes after the competition and rewrote it again. For retest purposes, I tested the original to see the time and then applied what I needed to fix the issue. There was a big time difference between the original and fixed code. I had written down the time differences on my notes but currently don't know if I still have them.

# Programming-Competition
These programs are from ACM 2016 Competition at Kennesaw State University

I'm resolving the problems from the competition that I went to in 2016.

__Problem 2 Buggy Robot__

IDE: Sublime 3; Compiled in Terminal

__Problem 5 Histogram__

IDE: Sublime 3; Compiled in Terminal

__Problem 9 Mismatched Socks__
When I first wrote the problem at the competition it had a time flaw, I figured out the issue from my handwritten notes after the competition and rewrote it again. For retest purposes, I tested the original to see the time and then applied what I needed to fix the issue. There was a big time difference between the original and fixed code. I had written down the time differences on my notes but currently don't know if I still have them. 

IDE: Eclipse
